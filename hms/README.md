## Features

- **User Roles**: Supports multiple roles including doctors, patients, and administrators.
- **Patient Management**: Patients can view and edit their personal information.
- **Appointment Management**: Schedule, confirm, and cancel appointments with doctors.
- **Medical Records**: Doctors can add consultation notes and prescriptions for patients.
- **Doctor Availability**: Doctors can set their availability for appointments.
- **Logging**: Integrated Log4j2 for error and event logging.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure to separate concerns:

- `scs1_group1.Main`: Entry point of the application.
- `scs1_group1.menu`: Contains classes to manage user menus for each role (e.g., DoctorMenu, PatientMenu).
- `scs1_group1.user`: Classes representing different user roles like `Doctor`, `Patient`, and `Administrator`.
- `scs1_group1.record`: Handles medical records, appointment records, and prescriptions.
- `scs1_group1.container`: Manages data containers for users and records (e.g., `PatientContainer`, `AppointmentContainer`).

## Requirements

- **Java 17**
- **Maven**

## Dependencies

- **Log4j2**: For logging system events and errors.
  
These dependencies are specified in the `pom.xml` file and will be managed automatically by Maven.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SunnyRaymond/SC2002-HMS.git
   cd HMS
   ```

2. Compile the project using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn compile
   ```
   
3. **Run the Application**:
   Start the application by running the `Main` class through Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn exec:java
   ```

4. **Interacting with the System**:
   - **Doctor**: Manage appointments, view patient medical records, and set availability.
   - **Patient**: Schedule and view appointments, view personal records, and edit contact information.
   - **Administrator**: Access all records and manage user accounts.

## Logging

Log4j2 is used to handle logging throughout the application. Logs are saved to a specified file (configured in `log4j2.xml`) and will help in debugging and monitoring the application's behavior.
