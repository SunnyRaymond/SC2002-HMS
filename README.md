## Features

- **User Roles**: Supports multiple roles including doctors, patients, and administrators.
- **Patient Management**: Patients can view and edit their personal information.
- **Appointment Management**: Schedule, confirm, and cancel appointments with doctors.
- **Medical Records**: Doctors can add consultation notes and prescriptions for patients.
- **Doctor Availability**: Doctors can set their availability for appointments.
- **Logging**: Integrated Log4j2 for error and event logging.

## Design Principles

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   - Focuses on having each class responsible for a single purpose or actor.
2. **Open Closed Principle (OCP)**
   - Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
   - Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
   - Large interfaces should be split into smaller, more specific ones.
5. **Dependency Injection Principle (DIP)**
   - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules but on abstractions.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure to separate concerns:

- `scs1_group1.Main`: Entry point of the application.
- `scs1_group1.menu`: Contains classes to manage user menus for each role (e.g., DoctorMenu, PatientMenu).
- `scs1_group1.user`: Classes representing different user roles like `Doctor`, `Patient`, and `Administrator`.
- `scs1_group1.record`: Handles medical records, appointment records, and prescriptions.
- `scs1_group1.container`: Manages data containers for users and records (e.g., `PatientContainer`, `AppointmentContainer`).

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Java
- **Data Storage**: CSV files for data storage

## Prerequisites

- Java 17
- Maven
