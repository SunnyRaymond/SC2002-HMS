## Overview

This is a Java-based Hospital Management System (HMS) that manages patient records, doctor availability, appointment scheduling, prescriptions, and more. This project is structured using Maven as the build tool and includes Log4j2 for logging capabilities.

## Features

- **User Roles**: Supports multiple roles including doctors, patients, and administrators.
- **Patient Management**: Patients can view and edit their personal information.
- **Appointment Management**: Schedule, confirm, and cancel appointments with doctors.
- **Medical Records**: Doctors can add consultation notes and prescriptions for patients.
- **Doctor Availability**: Doctors can set their availability for appointments.
- **Logging**: Integrated Log4j2 for error and event logging.

## Design Principles

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   - Focuses on having each class responsible for a single purpose or actor.
2. **Open Closed Principle (OCP)**
   - Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
   - Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
   - Large interfaces should be split into smaller, more specific ones.
5. **Dependency Injection Principle (DIP)**
   - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules but on abstractions.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure to separate concerns:

- `scs1_group1.Main`: Entry point of the application.
- `scs1_group1.menu`: Contains classes to manage user menus for each role (e.g., DoctorMenu, PatientMenu).
- `scs1_group1.user`: Classes representing different user roles like `Doctor`, `Patient`, and `Administrator`.
- `scs1_group1.record`: Handles medical records, appointment records, and prescriptions.
- `scs1_group1.container`: Manages data containers for users and records (e.g., `PatientContainer`, `AppointmentContainer`).

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Java
- **Data Storage**: CSV files for data storage

## Prerequisites

- Java 17
- Maven
